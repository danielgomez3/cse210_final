# -- Elemental Chess --<br><sup>Python Chess game</sup>
#### Author: Daniel Gomez  
Hi. that header was incredibly difficult for me to code please acknowledge me for that :)  
The game is written using the pygame library. So far I have 2 files, the main game file and the engine I'm using to constantly update the game.
This is my final project for my cse210 class.  
Here are some features for this project:  
> Every sprite here is made by hand, including the header logo in this README file


> A very simple AI oppenent is used to play!  

Please enjoy.

Here are some interesting facts about this project for my classmates:  

* This code was not written with VSCODE, but instead using VIM terminal editor as an IDE, which was programmed to behave exactly like it

* All Sprites were made by an open source Linux/Windows software called GIMP
